## Polos WordPress Theme

### About
Polos is a minimalist theme I needed for [my blog](http://kucrut.org).
Download it, (ab?)use it, or do whatever you want with it ( as long as it's permitted by the GPL v2 :D ).

This theme is made for modern browsers ONLY. So if you have many visitors using IE < 9,
either create a child theme and add the css fixes for IE, or simply don't use it :)
